# Here I am creating the recommendation system of netflix data. I have shared the data which i could and which was lesser than 100mb. The link for downloading the IMDB data is "https://kaggle.com/brownbatman/imdb-ratings?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=kaggle-dataset-share&utm_source=linkedin". Please recommend any changes which you think will improve my recommendation system
